I designed a hiding algorithm that identifies areas that are walled in on three sides - pockets - using lidar, and navigates to them using move_base. My project runs using *hider_real.py*, *scan_sim.py*, *timer.py*, and *my_odom.py*. The identification of pockets and coordinate calculation is done in *scan_sim.py* and move_base is handled in *hider_real.py*. *my_odom.py* and *timer.py* are helper programs.

In order to better develop my pocket detection program, I graphed the lidar data in the spreadsheet below. The spreadsheet also includes notes on the debugging process and the success of the tests.
